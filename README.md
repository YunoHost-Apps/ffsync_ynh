> *This package allows you to install Firefox Sync Server quickly and simply on a YunoHost server.
If you don't have YunoHost, please consult [the guide](https://yunohost.org/#/install) to learn how to install it.*

## Overview

The Sync Server provides a replacement for Firefox’s default server (hosted at Mozilla).

By default, a server set up will defer authentication to the Mozilla-hosted accounts server at [https://accounts.firefox.com](https://accounts.firefox.com). So you will still have to authenticate at Mozilla, but _the storage of your information will be done on your host_.

**Shipped version:** 1.9.1~ynh5
## Disclaimers / important information

## Configuration

Once installed, reaching `http://domain.tld/path` should show a page explaining how to configure it.

### Solving problems with Android

The sure-fire way to know what Sync on Android is really doing is to observe the Android device log using adb logcat. You’ll want to bump your log-level:
```
adb shell setprop log.tag.FxAccounts VERBOSE
```

Then, you can observe the log using:
```
adb logcat | grep FxAccounts
```

It’s best to observe the log while you force a sync from the Android Settings App. You should see output like:

```
D FxAccounts(...) fennec :: BaseResource :: HTTP GET https://token.stage.mozaws.net/1.0/sync/1.5
...
D FxAccounts(...) fennec :: BaseResource :: HTTP GET https://sync-4-us-east-1.stage.mozaws.net/
```
