The Sync Server provides a replacement for Firefox’s default server (hosted at Mozilla).

By default, a server set up will defer authentication to the Mozilla-hosted accounts server at [https://accounts.firefox.com](https://accounts.firefox.com). So you will still have to authenticate at Mozilla, but _the storage of your information will be done on your host_.

⚠️ This app is **deprecated and replaced** by [syncstorage-rs](https://apps.yunohost.org/app/syncserver-rs).
